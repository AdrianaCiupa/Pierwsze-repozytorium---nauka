        <h1>Within Temptation
        </h1>
        <h3>The Reckoning</h3>
        <p>As cold as stone, they march in darkness
            Enslaving the young and killing their fathers
            But soon they'll know the path they've chosen
            Has carved their faith in stone<br>

            In blood and tears, a thousand times
            We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

            <br>Red tears run down like a river
            Don't close your eyes, it won't disappear
            No fear you wanna end the pain
            Don't let go, don't back down, hold the line, we'll bring the reckoning

            <br>In blood and tears, a thousand times
            We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

            <br>We're all alone, walking in twilight
            The night has been long, and so many have fallen
            Feel no remorse, light will be breaking
            Our freedom is worth it all

            <br>In blood and tears, a thousand times
            We'll rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

            <br>Red tears run down like a river
            Don't close your eyes, it won't disappear
            No fear you wanna end the pain
            Don't let go, don't back down, hold the line, we'll bring the reckoning

            <br>I see your face, find peace of mind
            Between the madness and the sadness and the fire burning
            The end of war, the great divine
            We'll see the day of reckoning

            <br>In blood and tears, a thousand times
            We rise against, we'll always hold the line
            In blood and tears, a thousand times
            We'll rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

            <br>We'll bring the reckoning
            In blood and tears, a thousand times
            We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning
