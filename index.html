                <p class="text">As cold as stone, they march in darkness
                 Enslaving the young and killing their fathers<br>
                 But soon they'll know the path they've chosen
                 Has carved their faith in stone
                </p>
                <p class="text"><strong>In blood and tears, a thousand times
                 We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text">Red tears run down like a river
                 Don't close your eyes, it won't disappear<br>
                 No fear you wanna end the pain
                 Don't let go, don't back down, hold the line, we'll bring the reckoning

                <p class="text">We're all alone, walking in twilight
                 The night has been long, and so many have fallen<br>
                 Feel no remorse, light will be breaking
                 Our freedom is worth it all
                </p>

                <p class="text">I see your face, find peace of mind
                 Between the madness and the sadness and the fire burning<br>
                 The end of war, the great divine
                 We'll see the day of reckoning
